# Diabetes-Prediction-Analysis
The Diabetes prediction dataset comprises medical and demographic information of patients along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). It includes variables such as; age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. The dataset can be beneficial for healthcare providers to identify individuals who might be susceptible to diabetes and devise customized treatment approaches.
My analysis of the dataset was centered around the impact of age groups, gender, BMI, smoking history, HbA1c level, and heart disease on the probability of developing diabetes.

# Key Insights
The analysis of the diabetes prediction dataset revealed that age, gender, BMI, smoking history, HbA1c level, and heart disease are all significant factors that contribute to the likelihood of developing diabetes. The analysis showed that age is a significant risk factor for diabetes, with the prevalence of diabetes increasing as age increases. Additionally, the analysis found that BMI is also a significant risk factor for diabetes, with the likelihood of developing diabetes increasing as BMI levels increase.

The analysis also revealed interesting differences between males and females in terms of diabetes risk. Women generally have a higher risk of developing diabetes than men, even at the same BMI level. Furthermore, non-smokers have a higher likelihood of developing diabetes compared to smokers, and the association between smoking history and diabetes is more pronounced in females compared to males.

Finally, this analysis showed that older age groups tend to have higher rates of heart disease regardless of BMI. Among individuals with overweight or obese BMI levels, the prevalence of heart disease is highest in the adult group, followed by the aged and middle-aged groups. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of age, gender, BMI, smoking history, and heart disease in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans.
